# PromptKit - AI Prompt Enhancer [![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/waynesutton/promptkit)

Export your prompts in Markdown, JSON, or XMLâ€”done.

This application helps users refine their initial ideas into detailed, structured prompts. It asks clarifying questions and then generates an enhanced prompt based on the original idea and the user's answers. The final prompt can be exported in Markdown, JSON, or XML format, or sent directly to [Convex Chef](https://chef.convex.dev/).

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (frontend) and [Convex](https://convex.dev/) (backend).

This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`healthy-coyote-430`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/healthy-coyote-430).

## Key Features

- **Interactive Prompt Refinement:** Guides users through a series of clarifying questions to flesh out their initial prompt idea.
- **AI-Powered Enhancement:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o model (configurable) to generate a comprehensive and structured prompt based on user input.
- **Multiple Export Formats:** Allows exporting the final enhanced prompt as Markdown, JSON, or XML files.
- **Direct Send to Convex Chef:** Integrates with Convex Chef, allowing users to send the generated prompt directly in the desired format.
- **Session Management:** Tracks the prompt enhancement process within a session.
- **Clean UI:** Provides a simple and intuitive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **(Example) Simple Authentication:** Includes basic Convex Auth setup with Anonymous and Password providers (intended as a starting point).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) via [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
  - [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (likely for some components)
  - [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) for notifications
- **Backend:**
  - [Convex](https://convex.dev/) (Serverless backend platform)
  - [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) (for AI prompt generation)
- **Deployment:**
  - Backend: [Convex Cloud](https://convex.dev/)
  - Frontend: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (or similar static host)

## Project Structure

The main project files and directories are organized as follows:

- **Root Directory:** Contains configuration files for Vite (`vite.config.ts`), Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.js`), PostCSS (`postcss.config.cjs`), TypeScript (`tsconfig*.json`), ESLint (`eslint.config.js`), project dependencies (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`), Git ignore rules (`.gitignore`), and this README.
- **`convex/`:** Houses the backend Convex functions, including schema definition (`schema.ts`), authentication logic (`auth.ts`, `auth.config.ts` - example), HTTP routing (`http.ts`, `router.ts`), and the core prompt enhancement logic (`prompts.ts`). The `_generated` subdirectory contains files automatically generated by Convex.
- **`src/`:** Contains the frontend React application code built with Vite. This includes the main application component (`App.tsx`), entry point (`main.tsx`), potentially authentication UI, global styles (`index.css`), and reusable UI components in `src/components/`.

For a more detailed breakdown, see `files.md`.

## Development Setup

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Set up environment variables: Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```
    _(Note: Ensure this key is also set as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your Convex deployment settings for production.)_
3.  Run the development servers:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command first runs `convex dev --once` (which includes pushing environment variables from `.env.local`), potentially runs the `setup.mjs` script, then starts the Vite frontend dev server and the Convex backend dev process concurrently.

`npm run lint` can be used to type-check the frontend and backend code.

## App Authentication

This app uses [Convex Auth](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) with Anonymous and Password auth examples for easy sign-in. You might want to configure different providers (like Clerk, Auth0) depending on your needs before deploying.

## Deployment

### Convex Backend

Deploy the backend functions using the Convex CLI:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

_(Remember to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Convex dashboard.)_

### Frontend (Netlify)

This Vite application can be deployed to various static hosting providers. For Netlify:

1.  Connect your Git repository to Netlify.
2.  Configure the build settings:
    - **Build command:** `npm run build` (Add to `package.json`: `"build": "vite build"`)
    - **Publish directory:** `dist`
3.  Set up Environment Variables in Netlify:
    - `VITE_CONVEX_URL`: Your Convex deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-deployment-name.convex.cloud`).

- Read the [Best Practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/) guide for tips on how to improve your app further.

## HTTP API

User-defined HTTP routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts` to allow us to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.
