# PromptKit - AI Prompt Enhancer

Export your prompts in Markdown, JSON, or XMLâ€”done.

This application helps users refine their initial ideas into detailed, structured prompts. It asks clarifying questions and then generates an enhanced prompt based on the original idea and the user's answers. The final prompt can be exported in Markdown, JSON, or XML format.

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (frontend) and [Convex](https://convex.dev) (backend).

This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`healthy-coyote-430`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/healthy-coyote-430).

## Key Features

- **Interactive Prompt Refinement:** Guides users through clarifying questions.
- **AI-Powered Enhancement:** Uses AI (currently configured for OpenAI's GPT-4o) to generate a structured prompt.
- **Multiple Export Formats:** Allows exporting the final prompt as Markdown, JSON, or XML.
- **Simple Authentication:** Uses Convex Auth with Anonymous and Password providers.

## Project Structure

The main project files and directories are organized as follows:

- **Root Directory:** Contains configuration files for Vite (`vite.config.ts`), Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.js`), PostCSS (`postcss.config.cjs`), TypeScript (`tsconfig*.json`), ESLint (`eslint.config.js`), project dependencies (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`), Git ignore rules (`.gitignore`), and this README.
- **`convex/`:** Houses the backend Convex functions, including schema definition (`schema.ts`), authentication logic (`auth.ts`, `auth.config.ts`), HTTP routing (`http.ts`, `router.ts`), and the core prompt enhancement logic (`prompts.ts`). The `_generated` subdirectory contains files automatically generated by Convex.
- **`src/`:** Contains the frontend React application code built with Vite. This includes the main application component (`App.tsx`), entry point (`main.tsx`), authentication UI (`SignInForm.tsx`, `SignOutButton.tsx`), global styles (`index.css`), and potentially reusable UI components in `src/components/`.

For a more detailed breakdown, see `files.md`.

## Development Setup

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Run the development servers:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command first runs `convex dev --once` and the `setup.mjs` script (for initial auth setup if needed), then starts the Vite frontend dev server and the Convex backend dev process concurrently.

`npm run lint` can be used to type-check the frontend and backend code.

## App Authentication

This app uses [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Anonymous and Password auth for easy sign-in. You might want to configure different providers (like Clerk, Auth0) depending on your needs before deploying.

## Deployment

### Convex Backend

Deploy the backend functions using the Convex CLI:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

### Frontend (Netlify)

This Vite application can be deployed to various static hosting providers. For Netlify:

1.  Connect your Git repository to Netlify.
2.  Configure the build settings:
    - **Build command:** `npm run build` (You might need to add this script to `package.json`: `"build": "vite build"`)
    - **Publish directory:** `dist`
3.  Set up Environment Variables in Netlify:
    - `VITE_CONVEX_URL`: Your Convex deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-deployment-name.convex.cloud`).

## Further Learning

## HTTP API

User-defined HTTP routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts` to allow us to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.
